Presidentelect Donald J Trump has again focused his penchant for unpredictable disruption on the rest of the world His remarks in a string of discursive and sometimes contradictory interviews have escalated tensions with China while also infuriating allies and institutions critical to Americafs traditional leadership of the WestNo one knows where exactly he is headed  except that the one country he is not criticizing is Russia and its president Vladimir V Putin For now And that he is an enthusiastic cheerleader of Brexit and an unaffiliated Britain For nowMr Trumpfs unpredictability is perhaps his most predictable characteristic The world is accustomed to his provocative Twitter messages but is less clear about whether his remarks represent meaningful new policy guidelines

Mr Trump as a legitimate president because of questions about whether Russian hacking had affected the American electionIf you can disrespect John Lewis on Martin Luther King Day then what are you saying about the rest of ush Mr Sharpton said adding that no single meeting Mr Trump could hold would alleviate the concerns felt in the AfricanAmerican community gHe seems to have a onedimensional very negative view of what black America looks like and that is frightening to many black AmericanshMr Sharpton said he was concerned that Mr Trump was more interested in public appearances than substantive meetings with AfricanAmerican activists and lawmakers to address issues of voting rights criminal justice and policing reform health care and economic inequalityFor more than four decades Sala Udin lived under the shadow of a federal firearms conviction the result of a search by the Kentucky police who found an unloaded shotgun in the trunk of his car in Mr Udin who had been a Freedom Rider during the civil rights era carried the gun for protection as he drove around the South After eight months in prison he lived an exemplary life serving on the Pittsburgh City Council and playing a role in the cityfs redevelopment But when President Obama visited Pittsburgh in  Mr Udin wasnft allowed to meet him His criminal record prevented such an encounterLast month Mr Obama issued Mr Udin a pardon  one of just  pardons the president has granted during his two terms in office It is an abysmally low number for a president who has stressed his commitment to second chances and the importance of helping convicted people reenter societyThe White House has been trumpeting Mr Obamafs use of his clemency power in the last two years especially his nearly  commutations of prison sentences more than the last several presidents combined Most of these inmates were serving outrageously long terms including life without parole for nonviolent drug crimes Commuting those sentences is meaningful progress even if Mr Obama could and should have started much earlier and released thousands more deserving peopleBut when it comes to the other type of executive clemency  pardons  Mr Obama hasnft been an improvement over his predecessors Unlike a commutation which shortens or ends a prison sentence a pardon is an act of forgiveness granted to someone who has completed a sentence Pardons remove the stigma of conviction and restore the right to hold office to vote to obtain certain business licenses and to own a gun  all activities that can be denied those with criminal recordsThere is a better way In both liberal and conservative states from Delaware and Connecticut to Nebraska and Georgia the pardon process is more predictable and transparent Some states require independent boards to make pardon recommendations to the governor others hold regularly scheduled public hearings All take the executivefs job of granting mercy seriously which makes those grants both more fair and more commonOn Mr Obamafs first Inauguration Day in  President George W Bush gave him a good piece of advice Pick a pardon policy and stick with it Perhaps Presidentelect Donald Trump will learn from Mr Obamafs failure to heed that wisdomMr Trump repeatedly sought business in Russia as far back as  when he traveled there to explore building a hotel He applied for his trademark in

building Trump towers internationallyh said Mr Sater who worked for a New Yorkbased development company that was a partner with Donald J Trump on a variety of deals during that decade gAnd Russia was one of those countrieshThe presidentelectfs favorable comments about President Vladimir V Putin of Russia and the conclusion of United States intelligence officials that Moscow acted to help Mr

Russiah And he repeated gI have no deals that could happen in Russia because wefve stayed awayhThe project on the old pencil factory site ultimately fizzled And by the time Mr Trump entered the presidential race he had failed to get any real estate development off the ground in Russia But it was not for lack of tryingAs the Russian market opened up in the postSoviet era Mr Trump and his partners pursued Russians who were newly flush with cash to buy apartments in Trump Towers in New York and Florida sales that he boasted about in a  interview gI know the Russians better than anybodyh Mr Trump told Michael DfAntonio a Trump biographer who shared unpublished interview transcripts with The New York TimesSeeking deals in Russia became part of a broader strategy to expand the Trump brand worldwide By the mids Mr Trump was transitioning to mostly licensing his name to hotel condominium and commercial towers rather than building or investing in real estate himself He discovered that his name was especially attractive in developing countries where the rising rich aspired to the type of ritzy glamour he personifiedWhile he nailed down ventures in the Philippines India and elsewhere closing deals in Russia proved challenging In  Donald Trump Jr praised the opportunities in Russia but also called it a gscary placeh to do business because of corruption and legal complicationsMr Sater said that American hotel chains that had moved into Russia did so with straightforward agreements to manage hotels that other partners owned Mr Trump by contrast was pursuing developments that included residential or commercial offerings in which he would take a cut of sales terms that Russians were reluctant to embraceEven so Mr Trump said his efforts put him in contact with powerful people there gI called it my weekend in Moscowh Mr Trump said of his  trip to Moscow during a September  interview on gThe Hugh Hewitt Showh He added gI was with the toplevel people both

claim that he had gstayed awayh from Russia Alan Garten general counsel for the Trump Organization said it was a fair characterization given that none of the development opportunities ever

patients But his legislative record shows that over eight years in the Georgia Senate and  years in Congress he has advocated at least as much for physician groups and health care companies  seeking to limit damages in malpractice cases for instance and voting against legislation that would have required the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiariesMr Price has routinely argued that patients are the driving force behind his efforts Still his positions have often coincided with the financial interests of groups whose donations have helped advance his political careerDoctors themselves are sharply divided over his nomination and some are particularly galled by Mr Pricefs enmity for the Affordable Care Act and opposition to abortion rights Some of his positions even clash with those of Mr Trump who wants to pressure pharmaceutical companies on drug prices for example and has pledged to largely leave Medicare alonePhoto If confirmed Mr Price  will soon have far more power to influence the nationfs vast health care system than he ever did as a lawmaker One of his first tasks would be to help Mr Trump and Republicans in Congress determine how to eviscerate and replace the health law a goal he has held since the lawfs passage in  But as leader of the agency that oversees Medicare Medicaid the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Mr Price would also hold considerable regulatory power with the ability to influence everything from how applications to market new drugs are reviewed to how doctors are compensated for treating elderly and poor patientsAs Mr Price prepares for two confirmation hearings  the first of which is scheduled for Wednesday  his past efforts on behalf of healthrelated companies which have donated generously to his campaigns are under scrutiny So too is Mr Pricefs history of trading in biomedical pharmaceutical and health insurance stocks while serving on the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee Democrats have called for investigations into whether he traded stock based on information he gleaned as a congressmanLast year Mr Price bought stock

input into the purchaseh of the Zimmer stock which he said was made by a broker Asked why Mr Price had not directed his broker to avoid buying healthrelated stocks while he wrote and voted on health legislation Mr Blando said gWe know that other members of Congress including Democrats have holdings in health care stocks and vote on healthrelated legislationhIn a letter to an ethics lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services last week Mr Price said he would divest himself of holdings in  healthrelated and other stocks to avoid conflicts of interest Noting that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an gexhaustive reviewh of Mr Pricefs financial holdings Mr Blando said last week that Mr Price gtakes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriouslyhAlthough

gdangerous for politics and the economyhMr Price who declined to be interviewed was engaged in a number of pitched partisan battles even before coming to Washington in  In the Georgia Legislature he voted against a new state flag that minimized the Confederate battle cross and supported a constitutional amendment banning samesex marriage In Congress he has taken stances seen as antithetical to public health opposing regulating tobacco as a drug and favoring legislation that would make it easier to sell bullets that can pierce armorHe has also written a fairly detailed plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act It would repeal the lawfs expansion of Medicaid and provide tax credits to help with the cost of coverage based on age instead of income with older people getting higher creditsMr Price grew up in Dearborn Mich the son and grandson of doctors who heavily influenced his career choice He has publicly recalled making house calls with his grandfather who practiced medicine into his s After medical school at the University of Michigan he moved to Georgia completing his residency at Emory and setting up practice in Roswell a relatively affluent conservative suburb of AtlantaIn the s his practice Compass Orthopedics was among seven in the Atlanta area that merged into a large group that became known as Resurgens Orthopaedics It became the largest orthopedic practice in Georgia and now has  doctors and  employees spread over  locationsDr Steven B Wertheim another founding partner of Resurgens said one goal of the consolidation was to gain bargaining power with insurance companies and to provide MRIs physical therapy and even certain outpatient operations inhouse rather than referring patients to other providers or operating at hospitals More leverage with insurers often allows doctors to extract higher ratesgHis overall gist was eLook if all we did was practice good medicine wefd be broke by tomorrowfh Dr Wertheim said of Mr Price gHe understood the need to run a businesshAs a physician Mr Price was constantly frustrated by having to seek insurance companiesf approval for his patients to get an expensive diagnostic test or physical therapy  a common complaint among specialists Similarly he resented when federal health regulators intervened in something he and his partners thought they were already doing well like using electronic medical recordsThose are the things that drove him crazyh Dr Wertheim saidHis resentment of government intervention in medicine drove Mr Price to become involved in the Medical Association of Georgia early in his career and his work there led him to run for office in  when the House seat in his district opened up But by  as his legislative duties increased he traded his suburban practice for a job at Grady Memorial Hospital a vast chaotic aging complex just a few blocks from the State CapitolFor the next two years Mr Price was the medical director of Gradyfs orthopedic clinic seeing a vastly different population than the welloff privately insured patients he was used to Most of Gradyfs patients are poor and black and many lack any form of insurance Long waits for care are the norm and trauma including gunshot wounds is a big part of the caseloadgHe called me and asked if there was a positionh said Dr James R Roberson the chairman of the orthopedics department at Emory University School of Medicine whose residents train at Grady gHe needed some flexibility  that was most of his impetus to want to return to Grady because he was really very interested in pursuing a political careerhDr Roberson said that Mr Price played a gunique roleh at the clinic training residents and overseeing patient care but also seeking to address inefficiencies  long wait times for example  and representing the clinic at hospital administrative meetings Although he saw patients he did not perform surgery or need to be on call at night  an unusual arrangement Dr Roberson saidIn the Legislature Mr Price spent his first six years in the powerless minority although he quickly rose to the position of minority whipHis fortunes changed in  after Sonny Perdue became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction and persuaded enough Democrats to switch parties to put the Senate into Republican handsAs the majority leader Mr Pricefs intimate knowledge of procedural rules and maneuvers gleaned from assiduous research helped advance his partyfs agendaIn the state Legislature he was the leader who delivered bad news the nononsense tactician to some of his Southernborn colleaguesf more backslapping style His sense of humor when he used it was dry Colleagues often wondered if he sleptgHefs a machineh said Russell K Paul a Republican who served in the State Senate with Mr PriceDuring his two years in the majority Mr Pricefs top priority was curbing the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance which he said was forcing hospitals and nursing homes to close and forcing doctors to limit which procedures they performedgHe was very bright articulate and smart enough to be able to see the different sidesh said Tom Bordeaux a former Democratic state lawmaker and trial lawyer who negotiated with Mr Price over a package of bills Mr Price introduced to limit doctorsf liability in malpractice cases gBut he was just totally unwilling He was very gracious and he was completely inflexiblehUltimately Mr Price failed to persuade even his Republican colleagues to accept a provision that would have capped painandsuffering damages for malpractice victims at Mr Paul now the mayor of Sandy Springs Ga said Mr Price had become more partisan during his last few years in the Legislature when the Republicans saw an opportunity to tip the balance of power in their favor for the first time since ReconstructiongThere was not a lot of bipartisan collegiality when it came to trying to control the government in Georgiah Mr Paul said gand that environment was the crucible that began to turn Tom into a hardened political warriorhIn Congress Mr Price has made frequent speeches to health industry and physician groups and has occasionally

he spoke at a conference for companies that supply such equipment which held a ahead fundraiser on his behalf that same dayMr Price has also supported proposals to overhaul Medicare  potentially

and Business JAN   Samsung Electronics Pushed by Investors Will Consider Restructuring NOV  Samsungfs Galaxy Note  Debacle Wipes Out Its Mobile Profit OCT   Suave and mellow Mr Lee has often been portrayed as the right leader for a vast stodgy business empire needing to refocusThe bribery crisis has dominated the news for days in South Korea where Samsung and other huge gchaebolsh or familycontrolled industrial empires are embedded in politics and in the national identity Samsung alone accounts for about  percent of South Koreafs exportsThe countryfs largest chaebols have faced legal battles and convictions in recent years but these episodes often end with the industrialists receiving pardonsMr Lee might not be arrested at all That will be decided this weekProsecutors say Samsung made payments in exchange for a decision by the governmentcontrolled National Pension Service to support a contentious  merger of two Samsung affiliates Analysts say the merger helped Mr Lee inherit control of Samsung from his fatherIn a statement on Monday Samsung denied any bribery or making gimproper requests related to the merger of Samsung affiliates or the leadership transitionh But the move by prosecutors casts Mr Lee in a different light as a leader similar to his father who was convicted of whitecollar crimes but pardoned twice It also could raise questions about Mr Leefs pledge to make Samsung more transparent and more responsive to shareholdersSouth Koreafs president Ms Park has denied wrongdoingMr Lee who goes by Jay Y Lee in the West is part of the third generation of the Lee family to lead the conglomerate While his father was widely seen as oldfashioned Mr Lee has been painted by Samsung as equally comfortable in Silicon Valley and in the boardroom as a leader who could open up the clannish business and reinvigorate Samsungfs flagging reputation for innovation in consumer technology Samsung is the worldfs biggest maker of cellphonesgBeyond the arrest itself this is going to be a big blow to the narrative theyfve been buildingh said Geoffrey Cain the author of a coming book on Samsung gItfs hard to convince shareholders and partners they are a hip Silicon Valleystyle company when these charges show them to be a company run like a feudal dynastyhSamsung is in effect a collection of widely disparate companies each with an autonomous professional management team Samsung Electronics the most important of those companies is broken into highfunctioning business units Because of that some observers say that the company could continue to run smoothly without Mr LeeImportant matters that require Mr Leefs imprimatur could be delayed amid the distractions said Mark Newman an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein and Company gI think thatfs the thing you need to worry about big decisionsh he saidIf executives lower in the hierarchy are implicated daytoday operations could become complicated According to South Korean news reports other top company leaders have been questionedMr Leefs role at Samsung is not necessarily imperiled South Korea has a long history of pardoning the leaders of its largest familyrun companies Because of Samsungfs size past efforts to penalize the company or its executives have been met with worries about the effect on South Koreafs economyBut Mr Leefs problems could influence the companyfs strategic decisions at a time of major challenges such as how to bounce back from the debacle over its Galaxy Note  A spate of fires last year forced Samsung to recall and then cease production of the phone tarnishing the companyfs name and making it the object of airline safety announcements and jokes on American latenight talk showsAnalysts highlighted two executives who run large parts of the companyfs operations who they said could take on more responsibility One is Kwon Ohhyun who helped Samsung become a leader in memory and semiconductor operations The other Choi Geesung was crucial in building the companyfs television unit which eclipsed Sonyfs a decade agoMr Lee  is vice chairman of Samsung but he has been widely considered the companyfs de facto leader since his father Lee Kunhee had a heart attack in  The elder Mr Lee led Samsung from its roots as a components supplier to a maker of consumer products establishing a global brand and shedding a reputation for cheap goods In one example of his drive two decades ago he gathered  Samsung phones that failed quality tests and set them on fireUnder the younger Mr Lee Samsung has focused again on components a sector that has benefited from companies wanting to add features to their phones Late last year the company struck an  billion deal to buy Harman International to make smart components for carsBut Mr Lee has also pledged to make changes to ensure that Samsungfs corporate governance meets international standards As a familycontrolled group with dense links among its units the corporation has a structure that has drawn criticism from some investorsSamsung has also pressed for cultural changes to foster innovation and a startupstyle environment and Mr Lee has been portrayed as a part of that shift At Samsung he is credited with negotiating an important deal with Steve Jobs to help make the Apple iPodgStartup Samsungh an initiative announced last year sought to relax what many described as a strict corporate culture Announced with a coordinated pledge by top executives the push was derided by some in the technology news media as evidence of Samsungfs topdown structureDespite such efforts Samsung

arrested the man accused of carrying out a deadly attack on an Istanbul nightclub early on New Yearfs Day killing  people including a police officer and  foreigners according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency as well as Turkish news reportsThe news agency said that a police raid on a residence in the outlying Esenyurt district of Istanbul had resulted in the capture of Abdulgadir Masharipov whom the authorities described as an Islamic State militant of Uzbek nationality along with four other people The others were a man of Kyrgyz nationality and three women whose nationalities were not given Anadolu saidTurkish news organizations posted photographs of the suspect in custody showing him bruised and with fresh blood on his clothing and face He had reportedly been injured while carrying out the deadly attack on the Reina nightclub on the Bosporus An estimated  people were wounded by the attacker who went on a shooting rampage with a rapidfire rifle inside the crowded and popular venueThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack the next day and said in a statement that it had been carried out gin continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey the protector of the crosshThe Turkish authorities quickly identified the suspect from closedcircuit television and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to bring him to justiceTurkeyfs foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu posted a Twitter message congratulating the countryfs interior minister on the arrestgIn the name of our nation I thank primarily our minister Suleyman Soylu our police and intelligence organizations who captured Reina assailanth he wroteThe district where the suspect was captured Esenyurt on the European side of Istanbul is a former slum that has been rapidly redeveloped with new apartment blocks housing many refugees and migrants Turkish news reports said Mr Masharipov was with his yearold son when he was captured and news video

not go unnoticed and she returned for the final cheekily wearing a shirt that read gParental advisory explicit contenthPresumably Lady Kim wonft be wearing that sort of thing in the playersf box from here on either or at least she wasnft on MondaygI havenft found it distracting reallyh Murray said of the knighthood gI mean I found out about it four or five weeks ago Maybe if it happened a day or so two days before the tournament But Ifve had enough time to get my head around itJust as he has had plenty of time to prepare himself for the role of No  however long it lastsI asked him on Monday after his stuttering     firstround victory over Illya Marchenko if there had been any downside to No  thinking he might bring up extra demands or burdensgNoh he said gItfs been great I think because itfs taken me so long to get there obviously I want to try to stay there But also I feel like Ifm mature enough now to handle it Maybe if it happens when youfre very young you might feel extra pressures The responsibilities might feel a bit much but I think because Ifm much older and more mature itfs been goodhThe conventional tennis wisdom is that it is harder to hang on at the top than to reach the topgI hope noth Murray saidBut for anyone who believes that he now has nowhere to go but down that is hardly true in AustraliaHe has reached five singles finals in Melbourne and lost all five No man has done so well at any Grand Slam tournament without breaking through to win the titleOthers have lost five finals in the same major event including Lendl who lost five at the United States Open But he also won three Bill Johnston lost six finals at the United States Championships but won the event twice John Bromwich lost five finals at the Australian Championships in the preOpen era but won the title twice tooMurray at  is in unfortunately uncharted territory all the more so because Novak Djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the French Open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finalsgLook itfs still a remarkable record five Slam finals in Australia and deep down I think it means an enormous amount to Andy to finally complete the puzzleh said Roger Rasheed the Australian who once coached Lleyton Hewitt when Hewitt was chasing the title here without successBut Hewitt reached only one final in Melbourne Murray is  here and has a better winning percentage at the Australian Open than at any other Grand Slam tournament except WimbledongAndy played Roger in his prime and has been playing Novak in his primeh Rasheed said gItfs a handful of points changing the way the match falls Andyfs showing hefs in his prime now He just needs to get there and roll the dice againhMurrayfs timing may still not be quite right He played a great deal of tennis down the stretch in  and was beaten by Djokovic in a highquality final in Doha Qatar to start this season Freshness just might be a factor down the stretch as well as Djokovicfs eagerness to restore the pecking orderBut it does not seem quite right in light of their abilities that Djokovic has six Australian Open titles and Murray has not even oneHe broke down in tears after losing to Federer in  He stared vacantly into space after losses to Djokovic and sportingly came up with the right words amid major disappointment And yet he insisted on Monday that his emotions were not mixed when he thought about this tournamentgHonestly theyfre totally positiveh said Murray who plays yearold Andrey Rublev in the second round on Wednesday gIfve had a lot of tough losses here for sure But I love it here Played some great matches as well but just havenft managed to win the final But you know I keep coming back to try Ifll keep doing that until Ifm done but I
